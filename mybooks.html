<h1>HOW TO BE GREAT</h1>
<body>
<P>I at times feel sad and lonely,when i do ,i first listen to songs because they make me happy,then call people i love who,actually make my day.
</P>
<p>But sometimes you need more than just joy,you need to understand,you want motivation,so what do you do when you reach at this point?
</p>
<p>Yap!You want a book,a story to motivate you</p>
<p>You can thus find a book to read or a speaker.</p>
<p>The diappointment of a motivational speaker is:
They are not flexible compared to books,you know  ,you can read a book a book any time you want and on the other side,you can only listen to a speaker when
    he is available</p>
<p>Nowadays,thanks to the internet you can download a video of a speaker on your phone or laptop for example:Nick Vujicic
and Muniba Mazari</p>
